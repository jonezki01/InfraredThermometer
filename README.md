An infrared thermometer that measures the temperature from the surroundings as well as from the target, also displaying the distance to the target on the LCD screen.
This was my first school project and it was very much fun!

Used components: Arduino MEGA microcontroller, MLX90614 Infrared temperature sensor, VL53L0x Laser distance sensor, SH1106 LCD-screen.
